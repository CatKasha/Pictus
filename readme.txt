1. Introduction:
================
Pictus is a free image viewer. It is
designed to be fast and simple to use while avoiding to
waste precious screen space.


2. Using Pictus:
================
Well... Mousewheel changes image... +/- zoom. You can
customize most of the controls in the settings.
There are some super secret keyboard controls that can't be customized yet though:
	F2							Rename current image.
	R							Jump to a random image.
	Del							Move image to recycle bin.
	Shift+Del					Bypass the recycle bin and delete the image immediately.
	Home, End, PgUp, PgDown		Switch to other images in various nifty ways.
